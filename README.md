# Java Open Source Libraries Organization
The organization was created to make it easier to resume development, bugfix and deploy for useful open source libraries.
Sometimes authors cannot continue to work on a project. Even if it is useful and often used.
In this case, even a good developer has trouble forking the library.
It is not enough to suggest a patch to fix or improve. It is necessary to replace or restore the release process.

##### Why not Apache, etc?
Mature open source communities impose strong requirements for adding a project.

## Contribution guidelines
Any developer can join an organization.
Any libraries with appropriate open source license (MIT, BSD, Unlicense etc.) may be added.

To join, add project and discuss any questions about any activity of the organization, [create a new ticket](https://github.com/jopenlibs/.github/issues)

## Libraries
* [**vault-java-driver**](https://github.com/jopenlibs/vault-java-driver) - original project [dead](https://github.com/BetterCloud/vault-java-driver/pull/245#issuecomment-954066376). 
But the HCP Vault [reccomends to use the library](https://www.vaultproject.io/api-docs/libraries#java).
